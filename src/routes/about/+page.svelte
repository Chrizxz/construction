            <p1>
                Jim Atnip has been building longer than most people have been thinking about their first home. 
                He was out framing a house when his high school class was walking across the graduation stage, 
                and he picked up his diploma a couple of months later—then went straight back to work. Over the 
                last three decades, that early start has grown into a lifetime of experience, including years spent 
                overseeing large commercial and industrial projects as a superintendent.
